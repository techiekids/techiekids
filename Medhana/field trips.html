<h1>Wattles Elementary</h1>
<p>In my opinion Wattles Elementary i Troy,Michigan is an awesome school.</p>
<h2> Some Field Trips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Detroit Zoo</li>
<li>Greenfield Village</li>
<li>Lansing,Michigan</li>
</ul>
<p> These are only few field trips. There are way more. For every grade you go on 2 field trips.You know what you even get to go to the capitol building (of MI)(inside it) and Lansing Historical museum.
