            <p>Hi, my name is Abhi.  I live in Troy, MI. I am going to 6th grade. My younger brother is going to 2nd grade. I used to be in Wattles elementary school. Now I am going to Baker middle school. Coding is a really fun thing to do, it is a marvel making websites and webpages. And over all, coding is really awesome. I am in a class that is free with all my freinds in this class. And I am taught by my dad, a proffesional coder who works at Comerica bank. And read on for some fun facts.</p>
